Because this is a dream, the beach is completely
empty, and not a single person can be seen
swimming in the bay. And so, I swim as God intended,
au natural, naked or, as we said when we were kids,
nekkid. This nekkidness is the one aspect that happens
in dream as well as in waking life, but that is, well,
irrelevant. This isn’t a poem about me swimming
nekkid. I mean, let’s be real, I have some standards.
But the sea is calm, almost like a lake, and the water
is so clear it is easy to make out small fish darting
in little clusters nearby. The whole thing is so
goddamned peaceful and blissy. But then a man
almost as brown as I am, with a fairly neat mustache,
rises as if he is the man from Atlantis, rises as if
he had been swimming underwater for like a month,
rises and exhales with all the drama of a drag queen.
Okay, that may be pushing it a bit too far, but he
stands and breathes heavily for almost ten minutes before
swimming over to me. He says: “You know why I am here.”
But I honestly have no idea. This may be my dream,
but I am never in control in my dreams. When I say never,
I really mean never. Soon, we are kissing, our naked bodies
touching. We are completely inappropriate, but this
isn’t about impropriety, nor is it about sex. But we have sex.
And while I am inside him, while we are kissing
and his arms are around my neck, it begins. Our hands
begin twisting together and, without warning, our chests
merge. We twist and fuse and then the dark bark
begins rising from our skin, now one, one body, and
one skin now covered in bark. And this is awesome
in the old-school sense of the word, you know, as
in awe-inspiring, filled with awe. And lo and behold,
we are a single tree standing in the shallows, our feet
now rooted in the sand as the leaves begin erupting
from our branches. That two men having sex
become a tree standing in the sea might seem odd,
but I read a lot of Ovid as a child. And well, it
affected me quite deeply. I’m just trying to be
honest here. I mean, I feel I owe you that.
But when I wake, I am covered in sweat, my heart
racing and panicked. I lie there feeling the motion
of the sea within me, my skin prickling, my skin
softened and salty as if from the sea.

After Natasha Tretheway

In the Philippines, we abolish goodbye parties for Filipinos
who don’t want to leave—become overseas Filipinos.

Every colonizer wants to be remembered—see our country
whose name is a Spanish king’s name. Philip in Filipino.

The smell of mined dirt is gone. Chevron swims back
to America weeping. We watch, laughing—us Filipinos.

In a monsoon, we bring Andrés Bonifacio’s glowing bones
to a sugar plantation. There: an army of peasant Filipinos.

Their first 53 years spent lovingly burying piles of land-
lords. Every bloomed mango belongs to a farming Filipino.

My grandpa left & didn’t come back. Years later, I lay
in the river he washed in—my body, like his, Filipino.

His last name is my middle name, Verzosa. Spanish
as am I & millions       of  breathing             Filipinos.

2,Personal History,this was in the year when a ship took leave of the water floated out across the clouds when the clouds became the opened palms of the angels the year when the angels strung their wings across the telephone lines like laundry drying in the sun only there was no sun not that year that came later when the children turned first into horses then into ghosts when the rain fell in love with a poet when the poet forgot his own name then the names for everything else that was a good year a year without names a year when i learned to kneel without my knees ever touching the ground where the gods all prayed to us but i am getting ahead of myself i should start at the beginning,"
This was in the year when
a ship took leave of the water
& floated out across the clouds.

When the clouds became
the opened palms of the angels.

The year when the angels strung
their wings across the telephone lines
like laundry drying in the sun.

Only there was no sun.
Not that year.

That came later,
when the children turned first
into horses & then into ghosts,

when the rain fell in love
with a poet,

when the poet forgot his own name
& then the names for everything else.

That was a good year.
A year without names.

A year when I learned to kneel
without my knees ever touching the ground,

& where the gods all prayed to us.

But I am getting ahead of myself.
I should start at the beginning.

A peasant becomes fond of his pig and is glad to salt away its pork.
—John Berger, “Why Look at Animals?”

I vowed to give a rabbit religion, a weight to match
her bulk in my prepubescent arms. Sunlight illuminating
her ears like church windows: pink pulse, spider veins,
the altar’s velvet. When you hold a rabbit like a child,
her toes stretch to reveal claws like crochet hooks. Teeth,
unshorn, will grow until they pierce her skull like a crown
of thorns like a spear like Longinus like a stake.
I told my rabbit,   you’ll be eaten one day.
I’ve only taken sacrament once, barely remember
the wafer on my tongue, dry and disembodied.
But I have suckled tender meat
off the bones of young rabbits. I have drank
their broth, their marrow. What we know
about them is an index of our power .
My cousin’s bunny had a twisted neck,
one eye forever fixed upward. I had a parakeet
who died of a ruptured hernia. My friend’s guinea pig
lost both front teeth to a fall and starved.
The image of a wild animal becomes
the starting-point of a daydream:
a point from which the day-dreamer departs
with his back turned. I only pitied her
when I learned she wasn’t eaten. My rabbit
lived as a doe, a hulking presence in the hutch.
She grew beyond tenderness, beyond a pink
tongue-worm nursing on my fingers. She grew
red-eyed, yellowed, and mean. She heard
the kenneled fox hounds yowl. She heard
the chicken slaughter. The goose hiss.
The kittens bagged and drowned in the river.
Through the chicken wire, she saw the farmer’s boy
tie a mouse-sized noose for the morsels he found,
eviscerated by the tom. He hanged them on the doorway
for lack of lamb’s blood. And for this life I taught her
religion. Sat in a bathtub with a livestock rabbit
and said, These are your people, while I read her
Watership Down and repeated El-ahrairah, El-ahrairah,
remember who he is.

Needles in skilled hands
pulled through cloth or skin
move of their own

gilded volition.

             Taaniwe laakwa?

In Shawnee,
you ask
             where in time

as opposed to when

and it helps me

             consider folds of territory

tilled by memory and capacity
where the ones I tender
             bloom quietly and eternally.

A strain of heirloom corn
roughly translates to the word

sustainer—worlds

that germinate inside such a word;

wild horses, lilting shadows,
glimpsed in the elbows of the hills

             like opaque flags of prayer.

My distant kin in Neosho

folded deep indigo beans
into the palm of my hand

and said try them
             where you stay.

Within the words of a blessing
in my husband’s language

I recognize through repetition—

             The word for city.

             The word for garden.

Like an heirloom seed,

I was sown and cultivated
             back from the brink.

To rise within

             a place in time,

hands sorted
hundreds of seeds;
medicine and sustenance—

pallid disks of immunosuppressants
             and steroids.
             Flint corn from the Scioto Valley.

All those moments
I shook too hard

             to do it myself.

Running a finger

across the slight backs
of trade beads: cornflower blue,

             grassgreen, the white-heart red
                          a fire-flood of sunset.

I feel the shadow
of my aunt’s beading

wringing my neck and wrists.

Spells to protect

             my casing gates.

Cerrillos turquoise

             threaded into my earlobes.

Intricate blueprints

to the homelands
kept my toes
from the sky ladder’s

             sapphire rungs.

Sustainers are all around:

songs chanted
seven states away—glistening exhalations

of devotion and sacrifice,

             migrations of breath.

Adorn the skin with glass.

In a place in time

the ground warms and opens—

the hour is right,

             stitch a seed and it sustains.

5,Letter from Austerlitz,agate ivory without alliance i was told we would not fill the air with our difficult musics the audience then does not ever change— always a mother and shame and absent a worthwhile father so i came to know what it meant to go alone beneath the full buck moon to scratch a phrase like fragments are the only form he trusts onto the page but this is a letter and maybe one of the only places i will write it down suddenly i grew uncomfortable to be loved and broken to be loved less than the other,"
Agate, ivory. Without
alliance, I was told, we

would not fill the air
with our difficult musics.

The audience, then, does
not ever change—

always a mother, and shame,
and absent a worthwhile father.

So I came to know
what it meant to go

alone beneath the full
buck moon, to scratch

a phrase like  fragments
are the only form he trusts

onto the page, but this is a letter,
and maybe one of the only places

I will write it down: suddenly I grew
uncomfortable to be loved and broken

to be loved less than the other

Someone should let me drink
And please do not serve me drink
I have to drink through her eyes
As I wish to drown in her love
My soul is thirsty from the last birth
As her eyes were full of innocence
My eyes were dormant for the decade
As her beauty was unripened
My bosom has suffered from the drought
As her bosom was unriven
I haven't slept for nights and nights
Ah her tresses were unlike the night
We were apart since we were buds
We wish to drink as we are thirsty
Now the summer has reached our door
The fruits have ripened and the petals have fallen
So we wish to unite forever and ever
And have seeds to grow this legacy
The days of the union have been greeted
Ah let we two fall an eternal sleep

Unlike the ones they were.
They served on land, on sea, in air
They served within their time.

The old ones that we see today
Are not as they were then.
They walk with canes and ride scooters
Don't see them proudly marching.

We all may ask why there are wars
That call like these to serve?
Why can't we live in peace today
Why must we come to arms?

The reasons are beyond these ones
They only did their duty.
Did not control their destinies
But served with pride and honor.

So lets all stand and honor them
Acknowledge what they did.
They answered to the call that came.
And gave their time to us.

These are the ones that came back home
Must not forget the fallen.
Those who served and gave their lives
Will never be forgotten.
