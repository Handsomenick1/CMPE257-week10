After all

In the end 

If it was all just one long, strange, and pointless trip 

Then it was at least interesting

And that's the most important thing in the world.

1,Mind Fog,maybe something happens which propagates a deep unease that makes you acknowledge the weight in your brain and reminds you that you are unwell again volumous storm clouds roll in and take hold as well you sit with your feelings inside your head it seems as though a thousand years drift by within yourself as you wait for the interminable unrest to pass lightning strikes and thunder cracks internally a torrential rain begins to pour down washing over everything as it clears a thick fog settles over the moors of your heart then you come across a kindred soul your eyes connect and you both sense the sorrow and turmoil behind those eyes you feel an understanding underneath those puffy dark circles you both bare but neither of you say anything as the weight of that familiar pain is all too much so we both walk on and continue with your lives weathering the storm but not alone,"
Maybe something happens

Which propagates a deep unease

That makes you acknowledge the weight in your brain

And reminds you that you're unwell again

Volumous storm clouds roll in and take hold

As well you sit with your feelings inside your head it seems as though a thousand years drift by within yourself

As you wait for the interminable unrest to pass

Lightning strikes and thunder cracks internally

A torrential rain begins to pour down washing over everything 

As it clears a thick fog settles over the moors of your heart

Then you come across a kindred soul

Your eyes connect and you both sense the sorrow and turmoil behind those eyes

You feel an understanding underneath those puffy dark circles you both bare

But neither of you say anything

As the weight of that familiar pain is all too much 

So we both walk on and continue with your lives 

Weathering the storm 

But not alone

2,there's a couple sitting two seats in front,this was in the year when a ship took leave of the water floated out across the clouds when the clouds became the opened palms of the angels the year when the angels strung their wings across the telephone lines like laundry drying in the sun only there was no sun not that year that came later when the children turned first into horses then into ghosts when the rain fell in love with a poet when the poet forgot his own name then the names for everything else that was a good year a year without names a year when i learned to kneel without my knees ever touching the ground where the gods all prayed to us but i am getting ahead of myself i should start at the beginning,"
This was in the year when
a ship took leave of the water
& floated out across the clouds.

When the clouds became
the opened palms of the angels.

The year when the angels strung
their wings across the telephone lines
like laundry drying in the sun.

Only there was no sun.
Not that year.

That came later,
when the children turned first
into horses & then into ghosts,

when the rain fell in love
with a poet,

when the poet forgot his own name
& then the names for everything else.

That was a good year.
A year without names.

A year when I learned to kneel
without my knees ever touching the ground,

& where the gods all prayed to us.

But I am getting ahead of myself.
I should start at the beginning.

3,Love is Strange,sitting on a train with my head bowed in a quiet mourning for the couple sitting two seats in front or really for me i mourn for me me and my love and its cramps i am in love i am in love and once more i am in love not with anyone but with everyone or anyone who would see it through then each time i remember that the only thing i want to be is noticed someone can notice that even if i have to tell them to so when my sister tells me about a beautiful boy or a beautiful girl i do not feel hot tears behind my eyes i do not tell myself that there is an ugliness where there once was a child so when i see a person i barely know yet want with every fibre of myself when i see them with someone else there is no clutch round my heart,"
sitting on a train with my head bowed in a quiet mourning for the couple sitting two seats in front.

or really for me.

i mourn for me, me and my love and its cramps.

im in love, im in love and once more im in love. 

not with anyone but with everyone, or anyone who'd see it through.

then each time i remember that the only thing i want to be is noticed,

someone can notice that, even if i have to tell them to.

so when my sister tells me about a beautiful boy, or a beautiful girl

i dont feel hot tears behind my eyes. 

i dont tell myself that theres an ugliness where there once was a child.

so when i see a person i barely know yet want with every fibre of myself, 

when i see them with someone else,

theres no clutch round my heart.

4,Bead Workers,love is a strange thing is not it many got blessed by the love as it transformed their lives picking them up from bottom and taking them to the heights of the sky and for some its a curse that only put sorrow and misery in their lives once someone said something very beautiful about love and who loves the most a man or a woman by every mistake a man made and woman forgives just adds up love in man s heart for the woman but takes away a little from woman s heart as well so at the time comes when a man loves woman the most is the time when she do not even love him at all strange is not it,"
Love is a strange thing isn't it. Many got blessed by the love as it transformed their lives picking them up from bottom and taking them to the heights of the sky. And for some its a curse that only put sorrow and misery in their lives.

Once someone said something very beautiful about love and who loves the most a man or a woman.

By every mistake a man made and woman forgives just adds up love in man's heart for the woman but takes away a little from woman's heart as well. So at the time comes when a man loves woman the most is the time when she don't even love him at all.
Strange isn't it.

5,a player’s skill set,agate ivory without alliance i was told we would not fill the air with our difficult musics the audience then does not ever change— always a mother and shame and absent a worthwhile father so i came to know what it meant to go alone beneath the full buck moon to scratch a phrase like fragments are the only form he trusts onto the page but this is a letter and maybe one of the only places i will write it down suddenly i grew uncomfortable to be loved and broken to be loved less than the other,"
Agate, ivory. Without
alliance, I was told, we

would not fill the air
with our difficult musics.

The audience, then, does
not ever change—

always a mother, and shame,
and absent a worthwhile father.

So I came to know
what it meant to go

alone beneath the full
buck moon, to scratch

a phrase like  fragments
are the only form he trusts

onto the page, but this is a letter,
and maybe one of the only places

I will write it down: suddenly I grew
uncomfortable to be loved and broken

to be loved less than the other

We use black words on white pages to tell a story. To remember things we may soon forget.
We use black words on white pages to validate a point, to verify right or wrong.
We use black words on white pages to create and recreate spoken languages.
We use black words on white pages to cast a spell or to dispel spells cast.
We use black words on white pages for a lot of reasons... but... what if all of the black words on white pages stopped being...

9,Veterans Day 2022,the ones we see before us today unlike the ones they were they served on land on sea in air they served within their time the old ones that we see today are not as they were then they walk with canes and ride scooters do not see them proudly marching we all may ask why there are wars that call like these to serve why cannot we live in peace today why must we come to arms the reasons are beyond these ones they only did their duty did not control their destinies but served with pride and honor so let us all stand and honor them acknowledge what they did they answered to the call that came and gave their time to us these are the ones that came back home must not forget the fallen those who served and gave their lives will never be forgotten,"The ones we see before us today
Unlike the ones they were.
They served on land, on sea, in air
They served within their time.

The old ones that we see today
Are not as they were then.
They walk with canes and ride scooters
Don't see them proudly marching.

We all may ask why there are wars
That call like these to serve?
Why can't we live in peace today
Why must we come to arms?

The reasons are beyond these ones
They only did their duty.
Did not control their destinies
But served with pride and honor.

So lets all stand and honor them
Acknowledge what they did.
They answered to the call that came.
And gave their time to us.

These are the ones that came back home
Must not forget the fallen.
Those who served and gave their lives
Will never be forgotten.

Lamplight waves stretch across the river
as the snowfall casts its glassy arms across
the shimmering river.
Wreaths hung on lampposts exude cheer to passers-by
as Sol bows his head for a moment of pre-twilight
silence in this idyllic place.
Fireside chats reverberate from among the
snow-laden rooftops and the soft whispers of
falling stars cast their whispers to the early
winter winds, beneath sunset skies.
Golden light spreads its' yellow haze to brighten
a lonely snowman's evening; even the dog delights in
this Rockwellian scene of hope at Christmastime.
It's a night of peace for new beginnings
yet to come.
