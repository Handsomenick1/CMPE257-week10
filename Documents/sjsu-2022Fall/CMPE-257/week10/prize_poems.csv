I’m writing this on an ice cube, well, to be more accurate,
an icicle octagon, a wintery stop sign, the one near my home
in northern Michigan, where we moved because it was most

like Kuusamo, because we like places where there aren’t many
people, but a lot of snow. It’s difficult to write on an ice cube,
but no tougher than heating your home with wood. I remember

hauling wood, helling wood, being wood, how my childhood
was really childwood, the slaving over slivers, was my dad
and gloves, the path to the woodpile so memorized in my mind

that I see it now, daily, before bed, during bed, after bed, even
the few weeks when I moved into this apartment and didn’t have
a bed. But there it is. The pile. The wood. My dad. The sun.

The moon. The empty sky. The full sky. My dad would look
up at the sun and say, “Where’s its chimney?” We’d see God
hauling wood to the sun. He’d see each star as a sauna. He’d

sing the Finnish National Anthem, which began with “Our land,
our land” which really meant “Our wood, our wood,” and then
the next line—“Our fatherland”—my father singing this, his

voice echoing, father, land, fatherwood, sunwood, fatherGod,
the song, the heat, the cold, how they clashed, the song caught
fire, the sun ran out of heat, winter owned our lives, the house,

everything, and we walked backwards, to avoid the wind, and
got inside, and when I think of place I think of fireplace, of how
hot my back would be, my toes frozen, my father grabbing me

by the face, saying, straight into my iris, “You’re Finn! Finn!”
his hands so cold, my nose so sooty, my life so strange, night
like lightning, snow like heat, God like fury, the house so full.

1,On Agate Beach,Holly Singlehurst,a blue whale has fallen belly up on the sand and crowds of people stand round with wet hair hushed voices in their jewel bright shorts ​ and the first woman i loved split herself open from wrist to elbow and bled out in the bath up over its lip slipped under the heavy wooden door ​ and the floor beneath my feet is tiny stones and bones and broken glass worn by water and a whale’s heart is as big as a car and far more magical,"
A blue whale has fallen belly up
on the sand, and crowds of people 
stand round with wet hair, hushed
voices, in their jewel bright shorts,

​

and the first woman I loved split
herself open from wrist to elbow and bled
out in the bath, up over its lip, slipped 
under the heavy wooden door,

​

and the floor beneath my feet is tiny stones,
and bones, and broken glass worn by water,
and a whale’s heart is as big as a car
and far more magical.

2,Letter From Brooklyn,D.

All my life I feared death. Passionately, dutifully, sardonically, silently. But when it came, nothing changed. 

I still brush my teeth, worried the cinnamon dental floss will snag in a back molar. A nose hair protrudes. I can feel it between my thumb and forefinger but I can’t see it, no matter how I angle my face to the mirror. I dress in the clothes on top of the hamper. My shoes pinch.

I walk the dog on Eastern Parkway in the lightest of snows. If anything, I’m more present, focused on the leash, alert to yank him back from the things he loves in the gutter — a bloody tampon, the yellow intricate intestine that must have been a squirrel once. 

My neighbor Dolmatov is doling out peanuts to a flock of sparrows. They swoop in from nowhere, ignoring the dog’s outraged stare. The ones in front gobble — me! Me! The ones in back puff themselves up, flaunting the faint oil-slick iridescence of their wings. Their polls glisten with a sheen of sleet. Dolmatov rolls each kernel in his fingers and chooses the recipient: you and you.  With his free hand he cracks the shells. His ample belly props him against his walker.

“Snowy enough for you?” he asks. Like all neighbors, he knows nothing of death.                      

On the next block they are converting a padlocked factory into condos, working on Sunday in bitter cold. High silhouettes in flimsy parkas race across scaffolding, shouting jokes in Nahuatl or Bengali.                   

The child on his skateboard whizzes past me, close as he knows — there is no distance! Distance is mine! It takes all my strength to rein the dog in. 

Always when I was alive “life was elsewhere,” in a notebook washed blank in the laundromat, in a glance returned from the tinted window of a passing SUV. Perhaps death is also elsewhere?

The little Haredi girl wants to pet the dog — furtively, conscious of breaking a law — and the dog strains forward, fascinated.  Fascinated! Is that the only change? That and the swiftness of the clouds, passing from Jersey to the Verrazano in a heartbeat?

At night here are the tenements of my childhood. A single lit window reigns, making the city so vast, so empty. The face that shines there, always in profile — is that my father?

All my life I waited for you, passionately, bitterly, in silence, counting the breaths.

3,Every Poem Is My Most Asian Poem,Chen Chen,including the poems i have yet to write for example the one about the two gray pubes discovered during last tuesday’s trim or the one about the fourth hedgehog of the post apocalypse or the long tragic one about how the frenemy of your frenemy is your frenemy the short one that seems to be about love but is about suny geneseo the one about my best friend who always mistakes everyone for anne carson tentatively titled “why canada cannot stop weeping ” of course there is the one that begins exquisitely inquisitive i wander with my well moisturized elbows ends to aubergine or not to aubergine that is never the question this great poem i will never write for i am too busy staring at my graying or correcting my best friend in the end i only know the beginning the end everything else is a superlative question—a supervoid i have come to view as my innermost joy,"
Including the poems I have yet to write.
For example, the one about the two
gray pubes, discovered during last Tuesday’s

trim. Or, the one about the fourth
hedgehog of the post-apocalypse. Or, the long,
tragic one about how the frenemy of your frenemy

is your frenemy. The short one that seems
to be about love, but is about
SUNY Geneseo. The one about my best friend who always

mistakes everyone for Anne Carson,
tentatively titled, “Why Canada Cannot Stop
Weeping.” Of course,

there’s the one that begins, Exquisitely
inquisitive, I wander with my well-moisturized elbows.
& ends, To aubergine or not to aubergine, that is

never the question. This great poem I will
never write, for I am too busy staring
at my graying or correcting my best friend. & in the end,

I only know the beginning & the end. Everything else
is a superlative question—a supervoid
I have come to view as my innermost joy.

4,Image,Louise Glück,try to think said the teacher of an image from your childhood spoon said one boy ah said the teacher this is not an image it is said the boy see i hold it in my hand and on the convex side a room appears but distorted the middle taking longer to see than the two ends yes said the teacher that is so but in the larger sense it is not so if you move your hand even an inch it is not so you were not there said the boy you do not know how we set the table that is true said the teacher i know nothing of your childhood but if you add your mother to the distorted furniture you will have an image will it be good said the boy a strong image very strong said the teacher very strong and full of foreboding,"
Try to think, said the teacher,
of an image from your childhood.
Spoon, said one boy. Ah, said the teacher,
this is not an image. It is,
said the boy. See, I hold it in my hand
and on the convex side a room appears
but distorted, the middle taking longer to see
than the two ends. Yes, said the teacher, that is so.
But in the larger sense, it is not so: if you move your hand
even an inch, it is not so. You weren’t there, said the boy.
You don’t know how we set the table.
That is true, said the teacher. I know nothing
of your childhood. But if you add your mother
to the distorted furniture, you will have an image.
Will it be good, said the boy, a strong image?
Very strong, said the teacher.
Very strong and full of foreboding.

5,Sleepers,Arthur Sze,a black chinned hummingbird lands on a metal wire and rests for five seconds for five seconds a pianist lowers his head and rests his hands on the keys a man bathes where irrigation water forms a pool before it drains into the river a mechanic untwists a plug and engine oil drains into a bucket for five seconds i smell peppermint through an open window recall where a wild leaf grazed your skin here touch comes before sight holding you i recall across a canal the sounds of men laying cuttlefish on ice at first light before first light physical contact our hearts beating patter of female rain on the roof as the hummingbird whirrs out of sight the gears of a clock mesh at varying speeds we hear a series of ostinato notes and are not tied to our bodies’ weight on earth,"
A black-chinned hummingbird lands 
on a metal wire and rests for five seconds; 
for five seconds, a pianist lowers his head 
and rests his hands on the keys; 

a man bathes where irrigation water 
forms a pool before it drains into the river;
a mechanic untwists a plug, and engine oil 
drains into a bucket; for five seconds, 

I smell peppermint through an open window,
recall where a wild leaf grazed your skin;
here touch comes before sight; holding you, 
I recall, across a canal, the sounds of men 

laying cuttlefish on ice at first light;
before first light, physical contact, 
our hearts beating, patter of female rain 
on the roof; as the hummingbird 

whirrs out of sight, the gears of a clock 
mesh at varying speeds; we hear 
a series of ostinato notes and are not tied
to our bodies’ weight on earth.
